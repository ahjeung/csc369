I first plotted pixels that were first placed on each coordinate. \
![alt text](rplaceFirstPixels.png)\
\
Many flags appeared as soon as r/place started and as it expanded the canvas\
over the next 2 days. \
\
I also plotted pixels that were placed within 10 minutes of r/place starting or \
expanding. I couldn't find the exact times r/place expanded on 4/2 and 4/3, so \
is a rough estimate for those days. The top left quadrant is the original r/place on 4/1,\
and on 4/2 another quadrant was added to its right, and lastly on 4/3 the bottom \
2 quadrants were added.\
\
We can see the Osu! community got to work very quickly when r/place started,\
judging by their circular pixel art and overlaying with the other image.\
Users started by reserving a block for their flags, judging by the rectangles\
that were drawn as soon as r/place expanded. Users also wrote ENOUGH as soon as\
r/place expanded on 4/3, so it seems not everyone approved of r/place.
