My project is to look at US domestic flight data to determine which airports
could be causing delays in the flight network. 

I had to download my dataset by month, so I first concatenated each month's csv file into one big csv file.

For my exploration, I looked at flight data for 2025 on Tableau. 

I noticed some flights had long air times so I took a closer look at some of them. 

For example, I found a Southwest flight from Sacramento to Boise with an air time of 16 hours. 
After looking up this flight online, it was supposed to arrive at Boise at night but it diverted back to Sacramento and
departed again the next morning, hence it arrived 16 hours late. 

Interestingly, the distribution of delay times for flights is roughly normal and 75% of flights arrive early or
within 11 min past the scheduled arrival time. It is skewed with 10% of flights arriving over 47 min late, and 5% of
flights arriving over 1.5 hrs late.   

In addition, the times in the dataset (departure time, arrival time, etc.) are just written in hhmm in local time. 
I think it would be helpful to convert it to datetime, which means I would need to convert the departure time
(which is in local time) to UTC and add the total flight time to it.

There is a weather delay column in the dataset, but I cannot really tell whether this is a weather delay at the origin or destination airport 
For example, there could be bad weather at the origin airport hence the departure was delayed or bad weather at the destination so the flight
departed late to wait for the weather to clear up. I would try to infer this by looking at patterns in the data when I do a deeper analysis.
